The plugin is another try on Vim marks. Often I end up using two separate mark groups for navigation (a-f and t-z) so I created a plugin to simplify this. Version 1.1 adds the ability to display marks in quickfix and location list windows.

Provided mappings:
<Plug>ToggleMarkAZ - mark/unmark current position, if there are multiple marks on the line, remove the first
<Plug>ToggleMarkZA - mark/unmark current position, if there are multiple marks on the line, remove the last
<Plug>ForceMarkAZ - add an unused mark starting from a, even if the position is marked
<Plug>ForceMarkZA - add an unused mark starting from z, even if the position is marked
<Plug>NextMarkPos - go to next mark
<Plug>PrevMarkPos - go to prev mark
<Plug>NextMarkLexi - go to previous mark in lexicographical order
<Plug>PrevMarkLexi - go to next mark in lexicographical order
<Plug>MarksLoc    - open location list window with local mark positions
<Plug>MarksQF	    - open quickfix window with marks

Recommended mapping to put into your .vimrc:
nmap <Leader>a <Plug>ToggleMarkAZ
nmap <Leader>z <Plug>ToggleMarkZA
nmap <Leader>A <Plug>ForceMarkAZ
nmap <Leader>Z <Plug>ForceMarkZA
nmap <Leader>m <Plug>NextMarkPos
nmap <Leader>M <Plug>PrevMarkPos
nmap <Leader>l <Plug>NextMarkLexi
nmap <Leader>L <Plug>PrevMarkLexi
nmap <Leader>w <Plug>MarksLoc
nmap <Leader>W <Plug>MarksQF

So
\a and \z will toggle a mark at current line
\A and \Z force another mark
\m and \M go to next/prev mark
\l and \L go to next/prev mark alphabetically
\w and \W populate location list/quickfix window with marks

Also I suggest to install a plugin to visualise marks e.g. quickfixsigns (vimscript#2584)

Customisation:
toggle_marks_wrap_search variable controls whether search wraps around or not (order of precedence: w:toggle_marks_wrap_search, b:toggle_marks_wrap_search, g:toggle_marks_wrap_search)
Possible values:
-1 - use 'wrapscan' option value
 0 - do not wrap
 1 - always wrap (default)

Variables below define which marks should be displayed in loclist and quickfix windows respectively
let g:lmarks_names = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz''.'
let g:gmarks_names = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'

I use the plugin on daily basis. If you found any problems or want to suggest a feature, drop me an email.
